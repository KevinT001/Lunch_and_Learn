## Project Overview
Back-end portion of a Service Oriented Architecture  application to search for cuisines by country, and provide opportunity to learn more about that countries culture. This app will allow users to search for recipes by country, favorite recipes, and learn more about a particular country.


## Learning Goals

- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc).
